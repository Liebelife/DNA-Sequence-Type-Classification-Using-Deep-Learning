total_optimization_steps: 35415
how many 'eval_steps' to set: 3542
how many steps in each evaluation stop: 250
hence in total: 885500 steps for the whole evaluation
Some weights of the model checkpoint at /home/lieberze/DP/Thesis/05_model_training/roberta-trained-new-tokenizer_params_4 were not used when initializing RobertaModelWithHeads: ['lm_head.layer_norm.weight', 'lm_head.layer_norm.bias', 'lm_head.bias', 'lm_head.dense.weight', 'lm_head.dense.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing RobertaModelWithHeads from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing RobertaModelWithHeads from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of RobertaModelWithHeads were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /home/lieberze/DP/Thesis/05_model_training/roberta-trained-new-tokenizer_params_4 and are newly initialized: ['roberta.pooler.dense.bias', 'roberta.pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
